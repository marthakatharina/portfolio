                        I am a passionate Digital Product Designer, focused on
                        creating visually engaging, innovative, and
                        human-centered digital experiences. With a strong
                        foundation in arts, web development, and UI/UX design, I
                        bring creativity and problem-solving to every project,
                        delivering solutions that are both aesthetically
                        appealing and functional.

                        Committed to continuous learning, I have recently
                        completed a masterâ€™s-level program in Human-Centered
                        Design for AI. This dedication to professional growth
                        enables me to stay on top of industry trends and
                        consistently enhance my skills, ensuring that the
                        designs I create are both innovative and aligned with
                        evolving user needs and business goals.

                    <p>
                        Beyond my fondness for design, I have a deep passion for
                        traveling, which not only inspires my creativity and
                        broadens my perspective but also helps me understand and
                        appreciate unique cultures. Ultimately, I owe my love
                        for authentic Indian and Japanese cuisine to my travels.
